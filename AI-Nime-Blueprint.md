# AI-Nime: Application Development Blueprint (MVP-First Approach)

This document outlines the complete technical specifications for the AI-Nime platform, a collaborative manga-to-animation web application. It is structured to prioritize a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that can be built and launched with little to no initial cost.

## 1. Low-Cost MVP Strategy

The primary goal is to launch a functional version of AI-Nime by leveraging open-source software and the generous free tiers offered by modern cloud providers. This approach validates the core concept—community-driven animation—before investing significant capital.

**Develop Locally, Deploy for Free**: The entire application will be built using free, open-source software on a local development machine. For public hosting, the MVP will use platforms like Vercel or Netlify, which offer robust free tiers perfect for hosting Next.js applications.

**Use Free-Tier Databases**: Instead of paying for database hosting, the MVP will utilize free tiers from managed database providers. Supabase (for PostgreSQL) and MongoDB Atlas are ideal choices, offering enough capacity for initial user and content data.

**Leverage Free Cloud Storage**: For storing manga pages and animation files, the MVP will use the AWS S3 Free Tier. This provides 5GB of storage for the first 12 months, which is sufficient for initial content. You only pay if you exceed these limits.

**Defer Resource-Intensive Features**: The AI-assisted features, such as in-between frame generation, are powerful but require significant computational resources. The document explicitly states these AI tools are secondary to the platform's core community-driven nature. Therefore, the MVP will launch without the AI features, focusing on the essential collaborative animation tools and community spaces. This aligns perfectly with the phased roadmap.

## 2. Technology Stack

This stack is chosen for its scalability, real-time capabilities, and cost-effectiveness for an MVP.

**Frontend**: Next.js (React) - Open-source. Ideal for performance and can be hosted for free on platforms like Vercel.

**Backend**: Node.js with NestJS - Open-source. Provides a scalable, organized backend structure.

**Database**:

- PostgreSQL: (Hosted on Supabase - Free Tier) - For structured data like user profiles, manga metadata, and project information.
- MongoDB: (Hosted on MongoDB Atlas - Free Tier) - For flexible data like forum discussions and comments.

**Real-Time Communication**: WebSockets (via Socket.io) - Open-source. Essential for the collaborative animation editor and live chat.

**Cloud Storage**: Amazon S3 (Free Tier) - For storing manga chapter images and animation project files.

**Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) - An open standard implemented with free libraries.

**AI Services (Post-MVP)**: Python with TensorFlow/PyTorch - The software is free, but the GPU compute power required incurs costs. This feature will be implemented after the MVP is validated.

## 5. Web-Based Animation Canvas

The animation editor is a core feature of the MVP. It will be built as a functional, manual animation tool first.

### Technology

- **Canvas API**: The HTML5 `<canvas>` element will be the foundation.
- **Fabric.js or Konva.js**: A JavaScript library to provide an object model on top of the canvas, making it easier to manage layers and tools.

### MVP Functionality

- **Toolbar**: Pencil/Brush, Eraser, Onion Skinning toggle, and Layer management.
- **Timeline**: A simple horizontal strip of frames that can be added, deleted, and reordered. Clicking a frame loads it onto the canvas.
- **Save/Publish**: Buttons to save a draft to the user's library or publish it to the project page.
- **AI Assist Button (Disabled for MVP)**: The UI button can exist but will be disabled or show a "Coming Soon" message, generating user interest for a future update.

## 6. Real-Time Collaboration

WebSockets will power the collaborative aspects of the platform.

- **Team Chat**: Each team will have its own chat room for communication and coordination.
- **Live Co-editing (Post-MVP)**: Real-time co-editing of animation frames will be implemented after the MVP validation.

## Platform Vision

### AI-Nime: The Collaborative Manga Animation Platform

**Tagline**: Build together. Animate together. Watch together.

### What is AI-Nime?

Welcome to AI-Nime, a revolutionary collaborative platform that redefines the journey of manga from static pages to dynamic animation. At its core, AI-Nime provides a vibrant ecosystem where manga creators can publish their original works, and a global community of animators, from seasoned professionals to passionate hobbyists, can unite to bring these stories to life.

### Who is AI-Nime For?

- **Manga Artists and Creators**: For artists eager to expand their reach beyond traditional manga readership and see their stories transformed into dynamic animations.
- **Aspiring and Professional Animators**: A dedicated space for animators passionate about storytelling, offering creative freedom and financial rewards.
- **Hobbyist Animators**: Creative individuals who animate for fun, personal projects, or self-expression.
- **Casual Fan Base Members**: Even fans without professional animation experience can contribute through feedback and community engagement.

### Platform Components

#### Content Side (Viewer Hub)

The Content Side serves as the viewer's hub, much like a streaming service. It showcases multiple titles, each represented by a cover image and title card.

- For manga, a drop-down lists available chapters for reading.
- If animations exist, a separate section displays animated chapters for watching.
- Each chapter features its own comment section for fan engagement and discussion.

#### Publishing Side (Creator Portal)

This section is where new creatives upload their original drawn content, primarily manga and manhua. By publishing their work on AI-Nime, creators agree to relinquish certain licensing rights while retaining others that allow them to profit from any animation derived from their work.

#### Animation Side (Collaborative Production)

Animators can select manga series they're passionate about and begin collaborative animation. This process is structured like mini animation studios, where fan bases and communities form teams to animate a specific manga.

### Monetization Model

AI-Nime's primary monetization strategy is ad revenue, similar to YouTube, making the platform free to access for all viewers. Additional revenue streams include:

- Ad-free subscription tier (post-scale)
- Direct donations to creators (with small platform fee)
- Royalties for original manga creators from monetized animations

### Development Roadmap

## 8. Authentication Flow & Security Strategy

### 8.1 Authentication Flow Diagram

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   User Login    │───▶│  Next.js API     │───▶│  JWT Issued     │
│   (Email/Pwd)   │    │  Route (/api/auth)│    │  with Role      │

                                │                        │
                                ▼                        ▼
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│  Route Guard    │◀───│  Middleware      │◀───│  Stored in      │
│  (Protected)    │    │  (Check JWT)     │    │  Cookie/Header  │
└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
                                │
                                ▼
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐

│  & Permissions  │    │  (Role/Claims)   │    │  with Token     │
└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

#### 8.1.1 Detailed Flow Steps

1. **User Login**: User enters email/password or uses social login
2. **API Route**: Next.js API route validates credentials against database
3. **JWT Generation**: Server issues JWT with user role and claims
4. **Token Storage**: JWT stored in HTTP-only cookie or Authorization header
5. **Middleware Check**: Next.js middleware validates JWT on protected routes
6. **Route Protection**: Unauthorized users redirected to login
7. **User Context**: Decoded JWT provides user profile and permissions
8. **API Requests**: Subsequent requests include JWT for authentication

### 8.2 Authentication Strategy Options

#### 8.2.1 Option 1: Custom JWT Implementation (MVP)

**Pros:**

- Full control over authentication logic
- No external dependencies
- Customizable token structure
- Cost-effective for MVP

**Cons:**

- More development time
- Security considerations (token refresh, CSRF protection)
- Manual implementation of password reset, email verification

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// /api/auth/login
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { email, password } = await req.json();

  // Validate credentials
  const user = await validateUser(email, password);

  if (!user) {
    return Response.json({ error: "Invalid credentials" }, { status: 401 });
  }

  // Generate JWT
  const token = jwt.sign(
    { userId: user.id, role: user.role, email: user.email },
    process.env.JWT_SECRET!,
    { expiresIn: "7d" }
  );

  // Set HTTP-only cookie
  const response = Response.json({
    user: { id: user.id, email: user.email, role: user.role },
  });
  response.cookies.set("auth-token", token, {
    httpOnly: true,
    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production",
    sameSite: "strict",
    maxAge: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60, // 7 days
  });

  return response;
}
```

#### 8.2.2 Option 2: Supabase Auth (Recommended for Scale)

**Pros:**

- Built-in social login (Google, GitHub, Discord)
- Automatic password reset and email verification
- Rate limiting and security features
- Real-time subscriptions
- Row Level Security (RLS)
- Free tier with generous limits

**Cons:**

- Vendor lock-in to Supabase
- Learning curve for team
- Potential costs at scale

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// Using Supabase Auth
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";

const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!
);

// Login
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
  email: "user@example.com",
  password: "password",
});

// Social login
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
  provider: "google",
});
```

#### 8.2.3 Option 3: NextAuth.js (Hybrid Approach)

**Pros:**

- Multiple authentication providers
- Built-in session management
- JWT and database adapters
- Easy to implement
- Great documentation

**Cons:**

- Additional dependency
- Some configuration complexity
- Limited real-time features

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import CredentialsProvider from "next-auth/providers/credentials";

export default NextAuth({
  providers: [
    CredentialsProvider({
      name: "Credentials",
      credentials: {
        email: { label: "Email", type: "email" },
        password: { label: "Password", type: "password" },
      },
      async authorize(credentials) {
        // Validate credentials and return user
        const user = await validateUser(
          credentials?.email,
          credentials?.password
        );
        return user;
      },
    }),
    GoogleProvider({
      clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_ID!,
      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_SECRET!,
    }),
  ],
  session: {
    strategy: "jwt",
  },
  callbacks: {
    async jwt({ token, user }) {
      if (user) {
        token.role = user.role;
      }
      return token;
    },
    async session({ session, token }) {
      session.user.role = token.role;
      return session;
    },
  },
});
```

### 8.3 Recommended Authentication Strategy

#### 8.3.1 Phase 1 (MVP): Custom JWT Implementation

**Rationale:**

- Faster development for MVP validation
- No external dependencies or costs
- Full control over user experience
- Easy to migrate to Supabase later

**Features:**

- Email/password authentication
- JWT with role-based access
- HTTP-only cookies for security
- Basic password reset flow
- Email verification (optional for MVP)

#### 8.3.2 Phase 2 (Scale): Migrate to Supabase Auth

**Rationale:**

- Built-in social login for user growth
- Advanced security features
- Real-time collaboration support
- Row Level Security for data protection
- Cost-effective at scale

**Migration Strategy:**

1. Implement Supabase Auth alongside existing JWT
2. Add social login providers
3. Migrate existing users to Supabase
4. Implement Row Level Security
5. Remove custom JWT implementation

### 8.4 Security Considerations

#### 8.4.1 JWT Security

- **Secret Management**: Use strong, environment-based secrets
- **Token Expiration**: Short-lived tokens (7 days max)
- **Refresh Tokens**: Implement refresh token rotation
- **CSRF Protection**: Use SameSite cookies and CSRF tokens

#### 8.4.2 Password Security

- **Hashing**: Use bcrypt with salt rounds (12+)
- **Password Policy**: Enforce strong password requirements
- **Rate Limiting**: Limit login attempts
- **Account Lockout**: Temporary lockout after failed attempts

#### 8.4.3 Session Security

- **HTTP-Only Cookies**: Prevent XSS attacks
- **Secure Cookies**: Use HTTPS in production
- **Session Timeout**: Automatic logout after inactivity
- **Device Management**: Track and manage active sessions

### 8.5 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

#### 8.5.1 User Roles

```typescript
enum UserRole {
  VIEWER = "viewer", // Can view content and comment
  CREATOR = "creator", // Can upload manga and create projects
  ANIMATOR = "animator", // Can participate in animation projects
  MODERATOR = "moderator", // Can moderate content and users
  ADMIN = "admin", // Full platform access
}
```

#### 8.5.2 Permission Matrix

| Feature          | Viewer | Creator | Animator | Moderator | Admin |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------- | -------- | --------- | ----- |
| View Content     | ✅     | ✅      | ✅       | ✅        | ✅    |
| Comment          | ✅     | ✅      | ✅       | ✅        | ✅    |
| Upload Manga     | ❌     | ✅      | ❌       | ✅        | ✅    |
| Create Projects  | ❌     | ✅      | ✅       | ✅        | ✅    |
| Moderate Content | ❌     | ❌      | ❌       | ✅        | ✅    |
| Manage Users     | ❌     | ❌      | ❌       | ❌        | ✅    |
