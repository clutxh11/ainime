## Common Queries

### Get Projects with Creator Info

```sql
SELECT p.*, u.username as creator_name
FROM projects p
LEFT JOIN users u ON p.creator_id = u.id
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC;
```

### Get Teams with Member Count

```sql
SELECT t.*, u.username as leader_name, COUNT(tm.id) as member_count
FROM teams t
LEFT JOIN users u ON t.leader_id = u.id
LEFT JOIN team_members tm ON t.id = tm.team_id
GROUP BY t.id, u.username;
```

### Get Forum Posts with Author

```sql
SELECT fp.*, u.username as author_name
FROM forum_posts fp
LEFT JOIN users u ON fp.author_id = u.id
ORDER BY fp.created_at DESC;
```

## Security Policies

All tables have Row Level Security (RLS) enabled with appropriate policies:

- **Users**: Can read all users, update own profile
- **Projects**: Can read all projects, create/update own projects
- **Teams**: Can read all teams, create/update if leader
- **Team Members**: Can read team members, join/leave teams
- **Chapters**: Can read all chapters, create/update for own projects
- **Forum Posts**: Can read all posts, create/update own posts
- **Animation Projects**: Can read all, create/update own projects

## Indexes

Performance indexes are created on:

- Foreign key columns
- Frequently searched columns (title, genre, status)
- Timestamp columns for sorting
- Array columns for tag searches

This schema provides a solid foundation for the AI Nime Platform with proper relationships, security, and performance optimization.
