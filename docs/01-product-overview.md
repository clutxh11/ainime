**For Manga Fans:**

- **Content Scarcity**: Favorite manga rarely gets animated adaptations
- **No Agency**: Fans can only wait and hope for studio announcements
- **Quality Control**: No way to improve or iterate on existing animations

**For Manga Creators:**

- **Limited Reach**: Static manga has smaller audiences than video content
- **No Revenue from Adaptations**: Creators rarely profit from fan animations
- **Attribution Loss**: Fan works often don't credit original creators
