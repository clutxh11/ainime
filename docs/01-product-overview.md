## Product overview

AI‑Nime is a collaborative platform that turns manga chapters into animated chapters, led by the community and credited like modern creator platforms. Readers watch animated chapters; creators and animators build them together in a transparent pipeline with versioned assets, fair attribution, and optional AI assist.

### The problems we solve

- **Animator–viewer disconnect**: animators are invisible and underpaid. On AI‑Nime, animated chapters list contributors per sequence/shot with profiles and direct support. Revenue can flow to the people who made what you watched.
- **Fans wait years and have no say**: communities can form teams and move chapters forward now. If you want it animated, you can animate, review, vote, or fund.
- **Unfixable quality**: published chapters can keep improving. New versions can replace the default through voting; alternates remain viewable.

### Value (v1 wedge)

- **Chapter‑first experience**: readers discover, watch, comment, and follow animated chapters. Behind the scenes, teams work at sequence/shot granularity.
- **One pipeline**: Project → Chapter → Sequence → Shot. Context, assets, timing, and credits flow end‑to‑end.
- **Version‑safe**: storage‑backed snapshots + inline docs; signed URLs; restore.
- **Interop first**: import/export (PNG seq/PSD/Clip Studio/Toon Boom); no lock‑in.
- **Optional AI assist**: in‑between and style‑aware helpers that accelerate, not replace.

### Core surfaces

- **Viewer Hub**: chapter discovery, watch, comments, reactions, version chooser (current default + alternates).
- **Creator Portal**: publish manga chapters; manage volumes; licensing terms that allow community animation while keeping creator royalties.
- **Production Workspace**: project details with sequences & shots, team chat/DMs, and three editors sharing one foundation:
  - Storyboard Editor (pages/folders; drag images; rename; version)
  - Animation Editor (layers, onion skin, drag‑drop assets, per‑shot settings)
  - Compositing Editor (assemble shots to timeline; audio; export/publish)

### Attribution & economics

- Per‑sequence/shot credits with profiles; chapter credit roll.
- Direct support/donations (platform fee). Future: ad revenue share and optional ad‑free sub tier.
- Creator royalties for original manga adapted on the platform.

### Metrics that matter

- Animated chapters published / month
- Viewer retention and chapter completion
- Active production teams / week, seq/shot throughput
- % chapters with improved versions over time
