## üéØ **Updated Strategy Summary**

**This licensing-first strategy addresses the critical issue of content rights by:**

1. **Targeting Accessible Creators**: Focus on indie/mid-tier creators who own their IP and need exposure
2. **Value-First Approach**: Provide sample animations upfront to demonstrate value
3. **Win-Win Partnerships**: Revenue sharing model that benefits both parties
4. **Legal Compliance**: Proper contracts and IP protection from day one
5. **Scalable Growth**: Start with willing partners, prove success, attract bigger names

**Key Difference from Original Plan**: Instead of hoping to use popular franchises, we're building relationships with creators who want to partner with us. This creates sustainable, legal growth while supporting the indie creator community.

**Critical Success Factor**: The quality of our sample animations will determine partnership success. We need to prove we can make their work look amazing in motion.
